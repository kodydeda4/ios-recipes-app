## About this demo

This demo was created using [Epoxy-iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy-ios) & [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) frameworks. The code is structured as an SPM package to avoid circular dependencies and keep compilation times lean. The app is generally split into Clients (dependencies), Features (view-controllers), and Libraries.
